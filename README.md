The project involves creating a basic yet functional calculator that performs
arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Th
calculator will be designed with a clean, user-friendly interface and will be
responsive across different devices. It will be built using HTML for the structure, CS
for styling, and JavaScript for the functionality.
